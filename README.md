# Good-Food
A project made in the last year of high school in order to prepare for the Information Technology Olympiad.
About the project:
The marketing team of the "GOOD FOOD" restaurant, aiming for maximum impact in communication, diversity, and quality, has set out to create an application for online orders.
This allows customers to order menus of their choice. 
They intend to display the total number of specific calories for each product in a transparent manner for each order.

The purpose of their services is to raise awareness that nutrition is the process through which the body receives the substances it needs for growth, development, vital processes, and supplying the necessary energy for daily activities.

Therefore, the restaurant's online orders will be handled through an application that provides:

- Services based on the motto "diversity and transparency";
- The option for registration and authentication (as a client);
- Establishing a related database;
- The option to create an order containing various products, as well as the possibility to remove some of them before finalization;
- Generating optimal menus based on the user's daily calorie needs and fitting them into a predetermined maximum budget;
- Illustrating, through a graph, the total calorie quantity for each product chosen by the logged-in client
